Stage 1 is the surface level and 


Question 4
Looking throughout the project we encountered many of the idioms we learned in class. Foldl was one of the idioms seen mainly in stage 5 of compiler.rkt. Lambda calculus is used to help us create a basis of how ifarith and ifarith-tiny are suppose to function. Inside ifarith->ifarith-tiny the use of match cases are needed to contain all the cases need when going from ifarith to ifarith-tiny. Finally, another component of the function is the use of let and let* which we used in projects 3 and 4 to create binding cases for ifarith->ifarith-tiny.
