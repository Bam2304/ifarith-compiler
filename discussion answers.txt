Question 1
The purpose of ir-virtual? is to simulate how assembly works but in racket form. Some of the pros of using ir-virtual? would be that it looks like assembly and feels familiar.  



Question 2




Question 3
Stage 1 is the surface level and 

Question 4
Looking throughout the project we encountered many of the idioms we learned in class. Foldl was one of the idioms seen mainly in stage 5 of compiler.rkt. Lambda calculus is used to help us create a basis for how ifarith and ifarith-tiny are supposed to function. Inside ifarith->ifarith-tiny match cases are used to contain all the cases needed when going from ifarith to ifarith-tiny. Finally, another component of the function is the use of let and let* which we used in projects 3 and 4 to create binding cases for ifarith->ifarith-tiny.

Question 5
**April 26 at 2:31pm initial bug for let* which was already done for us
    **Changed the Let* and added quasi quoting which seemed to have fixed the issue
**New Error appeared with an unbounded x we are looking into the cause of this issue
